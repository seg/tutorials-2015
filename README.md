# tutorials-2015

Tutorials from [The Leading Edge](http://library.seg.org/journal/leedff) column, which started in February 2014.

These are [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). They can be opened and read (but not actually run) right here in GitHub, or you can install the Notebook software (e.g. with **`conda install jupyter`**), then clone this repo, and start a notebook server in the *tutorials-2015* directory.

For more in-depth hints on getting started, see Hall, M (2016). A user guide to the geophysical tutorials. _The Leading Edge_ **35** (2), 190–191, doi: [10.1190/tle35020190.1](http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/tle35020190.1).
